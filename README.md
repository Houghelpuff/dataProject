# @theRealShayon

### *A project by Jacob Hough and Nick Hanselman*

## Objective

**@theRealShayon** is a project for CSCI 2270 Data Structures, a class at the University of Colorado, Boulder. The purpose of this project is to make use of the information learned through the semester about data structures. We were given the opportunity to create any project we would like using any data structures of our choice.

## Project Description
Our project, **@theRealShayon**, is a tribute to our professor Shayon Gupta. We will map the words commonly used by our professor in a graph and keep track of which words are more-likely to follow others. By traversing through the graph, beginning at words that commonly start sentences and finishing at words that commonly end sentences, we will generate unique sentences based on our professors diction. The goal is to then send this generated sentence to a python script which will be controlling a twitter bot, simulating our professor.
