# Project Ideas

- mimic a file management system
- recipe manager (with mood for, keeps track of ingredients needed and which you have, enter ingredients user has and finds closest recipe, maybe a rating system (1 out of 5 stars, etc))
- Program to save all your usernames and passwords to websites (you can look up a website and it'll give you the information you need to input)
